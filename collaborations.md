# Collaborations

A business cannot survive on it's own; After all, it cannot build everything in the world. At DeVolt, we try to invest in collaborations with companies in order to grow with other companies. That's why we would like to highlight some of our collaboration.

EasyBat allows you to register, maintain and dispose of your batteries that you connect to your home. Thanks to energyWeb & IPFS, EasyBat can keep track of registration, usage, remaining lifetime, etc... in a way that you can trust.

#### Integration with DeVolt

EasyBet allows DeVolt an easy way to access battery data and know what batteries a user already has, thus removing the necessity to re-enter the information of your batteries at your home. Because of that, we're able to avoid repetitive work and offer a more pleasant UX experience.
