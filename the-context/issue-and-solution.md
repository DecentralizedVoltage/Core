# Issue & solution

## The issue

> _Design a solution to enable collective redistribution of green energy utilizing local energy redistribution to reduce carbon emissions at the community level._

## The solution

We proposed the community in the form of an apartment building. These apartments will generate green electricity through solar panels located on the roof.&#x20;

This green electricity will be stored in batteries in the building. This makes it possible to distribute this green power to the residents themselves without using the electricity grid. We would intervene as a medium with the residents and ask for a subscription and gas fee as a cost of the residents ( our income ).&#x20;

This would reduce the consumption of electricity by 50% compared to the normal energy provider.&#x20;

By using our subscription it is possible to use the stored electricity at the highest peak hours of the residents.
